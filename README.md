# Rowan — a self-hosted personal dashboard

A suite of nine single-file apps tied together by one bento **hub** (`index.html`),
one design system ("Patron" — soft-dark electric-violet), and one shared theme.
Fork it, deploy it (or just open it), make it yours.

### 🚀 Get your own copy live in one click

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/ohwisey/patron)

Click the button → it copies this repo to your GitHub and deploys it automatically.
No fork, no setup — you get a live `your-app.vercel.app` link in about a minute.
(Optional API keys for fitness-band & creator sync: see **`SETUP.md`**.)

| App | File | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Hub** | `index.html` | Bento launcher · onboarding · "Today's vitals" · live stats |
| Finance | `finance.html` | Net worth, subscriptions, orders, wishlist (+ live FX, optional stock prices, AI statement import) |
| Gym | `gym.html` | Progressive-overload coach (optional cloud sync via *your own* Supabase) |
| Supplements | `supplements.html` | Your stack + a profile-driven recommender |
| Whoop | `whoop.html` | Recovery / sleep / strain / HRV (real Whoop OAuth when deployed) |
| Water | `water.html` | Daily hydration target |
| Creator | `creator.html` | Posting schedule, accounts, analytics |
| Goals | `goals.html` | Goals & streaks |
| Progress | `progress.html` | Weight log + progress photos |

## Quick start

**Just try it:** open `index.html` in a browser. A first-run prompt asks for your
name + basic stats, which personalize the suite and pre-fill the apps.

**Deploy it (recommended):**
1. Fork this repo.
2. Import it into [Vercel](https://vercel.com) (no build step — it's static + `/api` functions).
3. (Optional) set the env vars below, then open your deployed URL.

## How your data is stored

Everything lives in **your browser's `localStorage`** — there is no central database
and no account. Two consequences, stated plainly:

- **Private:** your data and API keys never leave your device (except calls you make
  directly to Finnhub / Anthropic / Whoop with your own credentials).
- **Per-browser, not synced:** a different device = different data, and clearing your
  browser data erases it. Treat it like a local app, not a cloud service.

Shared keys used across the suite: `patron_theme` (theme), `patron_profile_v1` (your
profile), `patron_health_v1` (vitals — Whoop / Apple Watch / manual).

## Optional integrations

| Feature | Where | How |
|---|---|---|
| **Whoop** live recovery/sleep/strain | Hub vitals + `whoop.html` | Server-side OAuth — see [`WHOOP_SETUP.md`](WHOOP_SETUP.md). Needs Vercel + env vars. |
| **Apple Watch** | Hub vitals | No web API exists — enter your latest Health readings manually. |
| **Manual vitals** | Hub vitals | Type recovery + sleep; feeds the supplement recommender. |
| **Stock prices** (Finance) | Finance ⚙ settings | Paste a free [Finnhub](https://finnhub.io) key (stored in your browser). |
| **AI statement import** (Finance) | Finance ⚙ settings | Paste an [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com) key (Haiku, downscaled images — cheap). |
| **Gym sync** | Gym → ⚙ Settings → Cloud sync | Optional — paste *your own* Supabase URL + publishable key (else local-only). See below. |

### Environment variables (Vercel → Project → Settings → Environment Variables)

```
WHOOP_CLIENT_ID=         # only if you want live Whoop sync
WHOOP_CLIENT_SECRET=
```

See [`.env.example`](.env.example). Finnhub/Anthropic keys are entered in-app (not env vars).

### Gym cloud sync — use your own Supabase (optional)

Gym is local-only until you connect your own free Supabase project (nothing is shared
with anyone else). One-time setup:

1. Create a project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com).
2. **Project → Settings → API:** copy the **Project URL** + the **publishable** key (`sb_publishable_…`).
3. **Project → SQL Editor:** run this once:
   ```sql
   create table if not exists public.app_state (
     key text primary key,
     data jsonb not null default '{}',
     updated_at timestamptz not null default now()
   );
   alter table public.app_state enable row level security;
   create policy "rw app_state" on public.app_state for all using (true) with check (true);
   alter publication supabase_realtime add table public.app_state;
   insert into storage.buckets (id, name, public) values ('progress-photos','progress-photos',true)
     on conflict (id) do nothing;
   create policy "rw photos" on storage.objects for all
     using (bucket_id='progress-photos') with check (bucket_id='progress-photos');
   ```
   (Permissive RLS is fine for a **single-user** personal project keyed to one row. Don't reuse this project for multiple people.)
4. In the app: **Gym → ⚙ Settings → Cloud sync**, paste the URL + key, **Save & sync**.

## Local vs deployed

- **Local (`file://`):** everything works *except* Whoop live sync (needs the `/api`
  functions). The Whoop tab falls back to manual entry / sample preview.
- **Deployed (Vercel):** the full thing, including Whoop OAuth.
